#  Project #7: GPU Testing for LLM Blueprints

Project Page: [GPU Testing for LLM Blueprints](https://www.kubeflow.org/events/gsoc-2025/#project-7-gpu-testing-for-llm-blueprints)

Issue: https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer/issues/2432

Mentors:  [@andreyvelich](https://github.com/andreyvelich), [@varodrig](https://github.com/varodrig)

Project Size:  350 hrs

## Summary

This project aims to use self-hosted runners for running intensive tasks like LLM blueprint or planned AI Playground. The original idea is to use Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) with NVIDIA GPUs for this task. Any code or sample that requires GPU-intensive resources will be transferred to OKE infra instead of generic GitHub infra for faster and more efficient execution. 
For now, the idea is to have a specific policy where Jupiter notebook code will be added to a `trainer/example/self-runner` folder (e.g., in trainer/example/self-runner/sample.ipynb) for running in OKE infra. In the PR, it requires approval from one of the maintainers to trigger the self-runner build. I will set up the GitHub workflow for checking the changes in the respective folder. As soon as that is approved, the CI action runs the code using GitHub self-runner on the OKE infra. I will also set up a dashboard for monitoring and metrics to understand usage and bottlenecks.
The scope of this project is set up on OKE, but theoretically, this is platform-agnostic; it can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster with sufficient GPU resources.

### Availability
I am committed to dedicating 30-35 hours per week during the GSoC period.
    
Regular working time slots:
- 07:00 - 09:00 IST
- 19:30 - 24:00 IST

My working hours will be:
- Weekdays (Mon-Fri): 4 hours per day
- Weekends (Sat-Sun): 6.5 hours per day
  
I will have limited availability from August 5th to August 8th due to [KubeCon India](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-india/). I have also volunteered to help KubeFlow set up their booth. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
I have kept a buffer time to cover any backlog and blockers. Besides this, I have no other prior commitments. If any new commitments arise, I will promptly inform my mentor to find a suitable workaround.

[motivation about why you are interested in working on the project.]
I like experimentastion and contribtuing to oepn sopruce in my free time, from my work at oracle i started using k8s and jenkins. I was looking for anything to contribute to that, then I got Kubeflow.

## Goals
- Setup sample LLM Blueprint 
- Setup GPU nodes on OKE
- Setup ACR on OKE Cluster for deploying the llm
- Setup GitHub Action for manual trigger and runner on OKE cluster
- Metrics and analytics for the GPU Cluster
- [Optional] AI Playground on OKE


## Non-Goals

- Cluster with GPU should be provided by Oracle for prod deployment. For testing, I have my decent enough personal machine (Ryzen 7 8600G, 32GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 4060) to test this.
- Once the infra for self-runner is set up, running AI Playground requires minimal setup. The main scope of this project is to set infra for running the LLM blueprint on OKE infra. AI Playground is 2nd priority for this GSoC project, but I will continue if it's not complete within the GSoC period.

## Technical Details

TechStack: GitHub Actions (and ACR), Kubernetes, Oracle Cloud, PyTorch, Python, Nvidia drivers, Linux

- Setup LLM Blueprint
To setup llm blueprint that that can triggered based on admin approval. We have already one sample which i asked from @andrey, 

I have tested a sample project for running on my local system. Here is the branch - https://github.com/jaiakash/trainer/tree/test-runner
Screenshots: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cd595fe-4191-49f2-a897-cb8895d86438)

- Github Action
Create a GitHub action for checking changes in files in `trainer/example/self-runner` and wait to trigger the self-runner after approval from the maintainers. Once the maintainer approves the scan, the code is executed in the self-runner (that is OKE infra). Assuming it takes some time and resources, we will implement queuing so that resources don't get flooded with requests. We will maintain a queue for requests, and report the result back to CI accordingly.

- Setup OKE Cluster
Refrence - https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-hpc-oke

Trigger only on specifc file for eg example/blueprint/


- Setup GitHub Actions Runner Controller (ACR)
Actions Runner Controller (ARC) is a Kubernetes operator that orchestrates and scales self-hosted runners for GitHub Actions. This is advanced version of k8s operator that is useful for our requirments to scale and orchetrates pods based on the action CI. 

ACR architecture

- OKE Monitoring
For admins, we also need to maintain monitoring to see the metrics and resource utilisation of the OKE infra. Oracle already provides an open-source sample for [OKE Monitoring](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-kubernetes-monitoring), so we can leverage that. 
Out of various options, installation via [Helm](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/oci-kubernetes-monitoring#helm) is sufficient for our basic needs.
